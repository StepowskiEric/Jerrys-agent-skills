## If you want better output quality

These skills refine the agent's own work:

- `output-quality/bounded-self-revision.md` — structured self-improvement with stop rules
- `output-quality/tool-interactive-critic.md` — tool-grounded post-generation verification

- `output-quality/feynman-technique.md` — verify understanding by explaining simply
- `output-quality/mece-pyramid-principle.md` — structure outputs to be complete and non-redundant
- `output-quality/tree-of-thoughts.md` — explore multiple reasoning paths before committing
- `output-quality/self-consistency.md` — triangulate conclusions across independent reasoning chains

## If you are building higher-quality agent workflows

Strong combinations include:

- **ETTO + Problem-Mode Router** → decide rigor level and response mode first
- **Cynefin State Machine + Recognition-Primed Triage State Machine** → classify the domain, then apply the correct triage protocol
- **Recognition-Primed Triage + Unsafe Control Actions** → move fast, but with guardrails
- **How to Solve It + Pragmatic Programmer** → disciplined diagnosis plus grounded execution
- **How to Solve It + Analogy Transfer** → problem-framing with analog import when a prior solution exists
- **Working Effectively with Legacy Code + Refactoring** → make change safe, then improve structure
- **Thinking in Systems + Theory of Constraints** → understand the system, then find the true bottleneck
- **Toyota Kata + PDCA** → discover the obstacle, then verify the improvement with measurement discipline
- **OODA Loop + Checklist Manifesto** → dynamic tempo in fast-moving situations, procedural discipline in high-stakes steps
- **Pre-Mortem + Inversion** → vivid failure stories plus abstract failure-mode analysis, before committing to a plan
- **Six Thinking Hats + Steelmanning** → multi-perspective analysis plus genuine challenge of the leading recommendation
- **Kahneman Fast/Slow + Cognitive Bias Checklist** → switch to slow mode, then verify the slow-mode output is bias-corrected
- **DDD + Team Topologies** → align domain boundaries to team structures
- **Release It! + SRE Error Budget** → implement stability patterns, then govern the reliability-velocity tradeoff
- **Socratic Clarification + Pre-Mortem** → surface the key assumption before planning, then validate the plan against failure
- **Bounded Self-Revision + Tool-Interactive Critic** → self-refine first, then verify with external tools
- **Feynman Technique + MECE / Pyramid Principle** → verify the reasoning is sound, then structure the output clearly

## Practical skill flows

Use these as default stacks when the task matches the scenario.

### Extremely difficult debugging

1. `judgment-and-routing/problem-mode-router-cynefin.md`
2. `judgment-and-routing/thoroughness-check-etto-state-machine.md`
3. `execution/how-to-solve-it-state-machine.md`
4. `intent-specification-protocol.md` to clarify what correct behavior looks like before diving in
5. `judgment-and-routing/explore-vs-exploit-state-machine.md`
6. `execution/ooda-loop-state-machine.md` if the situation is changing while you investigate
7. `debugging/root-cause-analysis.md` if the bug is recurring or symptom-only fixes keep failing
8. `output-quality/tool-interactive-critic.md` to verify the conclusion against code, logs, or tests

Why this stack works: classify the problem first, set the rigor bar, force disciplined diagnosis, distinguish symptoms from real causes, then keep evidence and action in a tight loop. Add `execution/trajectory-guard/SKILL.md` to this stack if the debugging session exceeds 10 tool calls — it catches the failure spiral where the agent keeps trying variants of the same fix.

### New architecture or major design decisions

1. `judgment-and-routing/problem-mode-router-cynefin.md`
2. `judgment-and-routing/thoroughness-check-etto-state-machine.md`
3. `judgment-and-routing/first-principles.md`
4. `systems-and-architecture/thinking-in-systems-state-machine.md`
5. `systems-and-architecture/domain-driven-design.md`
6. `systems-and-architecture/team-topologies-ai.md`
7. `software-development/api-design-backward-compatibility.md` to enumerate consumers before changing contracts
8. `judgment-and-routing/pre-mortem.md`
9. `judgment-and-routing/inversion-mental-model.md`

Why this stack works: it separates problem classification from design, forces boundary, coupling, and failure-mode analysis, protects existing consumers, then validates the plan against failure before committing.

### Large refactor or cleanup of bad code

1. `judgment-and-routing/thoroughness-check-etto-state-machine.md`
2. `intent-specification-protocol.md` to lock the target behavior before changing code
3. `execution/working-effectively-with-legacy-code-state-machine.md`
4. `execution/refactoring-state-machine.md`
5. `execution/pragmatic-programmer-state-machine.md`
6. `execution/checklist-manifesto.md` if the change is risky or procedural
7. `output-quality/tool-interactive-critic.md` before claiming the work is done

Why this stack works: stabilize first, refactor in bounded slices, keep the blast radius explicit, and verify before closure.

### Large codebase search or bug localization

1. `software-development/codebase-divide-conquer-search.md` — hierarchical summarization, semantic ranking, and parallel sub-agent deep dives
2. `execution/how-to-solve-it-state-machine.md` — frame the query precisely before searching
3. `keyword-agnostic-logic-locator.md` — structural queries when semantic similarity is ambiguous
4. `debugging/debug-subagent/SKILL.md` — if the search is for a bug, use as the Phase 2 conquer agent
5. `output-quality/tool-interactive-critic.md` — verify findings against actual source code

Why this stack works: the divide-and-conquer protocol compresses the codebase by ~80%, routes queries to the right zones with 84.67% file-level accuracy (Meta-RAG), and uses parallel agents to avoid the path-explosion problem that kills single-agent searches in large repos.

### Following strong principles while deciding

1. `judgment-and-routing/first-principles.md`
2. `judgment-and-routing/second-order-thinking.md`
3. `judgment-and-routing/kahneman-thinking-fast-slow-software-agent.md`
4. `judgment-and-routing/cognitive-bias-checklist.md`
5. `output-quality/mece-pyramid-principle.md`
6. `output-quality/feynman-technique.md`

Why this stack works: it pushes the agent to reason from basics, check downstream effects, slow down when needed, and present the result clearly.

### Fast-moving incident or urgent operational work

1. `judgment-and-routing/problem-mode-router-cynefin.md`
2. `judgment-and-routing/recognition-primed-triage.md`
3. `execution/ooda-loop-state-machine.md`
4. `judgment-and-routing/unsafe-control-actions-hazard-analysis.md`
5. `execution/checklist-manifesto.md`

Why this stack works: classify the situation, take the first plausible strong move, then stay disciplined about timing, sequence, and safeguards.

### Better output quality or sharper reasoning

1. `output-quality/tree-of-thoughts.md`
2. `output-quality/self-consistency.md`
3. `output-quality/bounded-self-revision.md`
4. `output-quality/tool-interactive-critic.md`
5. `output-quality/mece-pyramid-principle.md`
6. `output-quality/feynman-technique.md`
7. `output-quality/stakeholder-communication.md` when presenting conclusions to humans

Why this stack works: it broadens the search space, triangulates conclusions, then tightens the result into a clear, testable, and appropriately calibrated answer.

### Specification-driven coding (any non-trivial code change)

1. `intent-specification-protocol.md` — state what correct behavior looks like before writing code
2. `output-quality/bounded-self-revision.md` — verify the spec is achievable and self-consistent
3. `step-level-verification-protocol.md` — check each unit of work against the spec before moving on

Why this stack works: spec-first eliminates rework, bounded self-revision catches spec gaps early, step-level verification keeps each change aligned with intent.

### Security review or production hardening (especially AI-generated apps)

1. `systems-and-architecture/security-threat-modeling.md` — STRIDE analysis for assets, trust boundaries, and attack vectors
2. `systems-and-architecture/vibe-coding-security-hardening.md` — 9-phase checklist for secrets, auth, RLS, input validation, and secure defaults
3. `judgment-and-routing/unsafe-control-actions-hazard-analysis.md` — check high-consequence actions for timing and sequencing risks
4. `output-quality/tool-interactive-critic.md` — verify security claims against actual code and configuration

Why this stack works: threat modeling finds the holes, the hardening checklist covers the vulnerabilities AI tools reliably miss, hazard analysis guards dangerous operations, and external verification prevents false confidence in security posture.

### Long-horizon tasks (migrations, multi-file changes, complex bugs)

1. `execution/context-budget-operator/SKILL.md` — track token budget before it silently overflows
2. `execution/trajectory-guard/SKILL.md` — detect failure spirals and force strategy changes
3. `execution/assumption-grounding/SKILL.md` — verify assumptions before each major decision
4. `execution/pragmatic-programmer-state-machine.md` — keep changes bounded and reversible

Why this stack works: long tasks are where agents fail most — context overflow, failure spirals, and specification drift compound over many turns. Budget tracking prevents silent instruction loss, trajectory guard catches stuck execution, assumption grounding prevents hallucinated facts from compounding, and the pragmatist protocol keeps scope bounded.
