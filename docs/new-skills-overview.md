# New Skills Overview

This document provides detailed information about the two new skills recently added to Jerry's Agent Skills repository:

## 1. log-trace-correlation (debugging)

### Purpose
Correlate error logs and stack traces to source code to identify root cause and suggest fixes.

### When to Use
- You have an error log with a stack trace (or similar diagnostic output)
- You need to determine which file, function, and line caused the failure
- You want to avoid guesswork and speed up debugging

### Detailed Workflow

#### Step 1: Collect the Trace
- Copy the full error output (including timestamps, error message, and stack trace) into a temporary file or variable
- Example: `error_log.txt`

#### Step 2: Normalize File Paths
- Strip base directories, resolve `../` segments, and convert to repo-relative paths
- If the trace contains absolute paths, map them to the repo root using the current working directory

#### Step 3: Locate Each Frame
- For each frame (file, line, function):
  - Use `search_files` with `target="files"` to find the file if the path is not exact
  - Use `read_file` with `offset` and `limit` to view the surrounding lines (e.g., ±5 lines)
- Record the exact snippet and any relevant variable names

#### Step 4: Inspect the Surrounding Code
- Look for:
  - Null-dereference candidates
  - Type mismatches
  - Recent changes (use `git log -p -S "<snippet>"` via `terminal` if needed)
- If the frame points to a library file, check whether the call originates from your own code (look at the previous frame)

#### Step 5: Formulate a Hypothesis
- Based on the snippet and error message, write a one-sentence hypothesis of what went wrong

#### Step 6: Propose a Fix
- Write the minimal change (e.g., add a null check, correct a parameter order, handle an edge case)
- Use `patch` to apply the change in a safe, reversible way (first run with `dry_run:true` if supported, or copy the file to a backup)

#### Step 7: Verify
- If there is a reproducing test or a way to trigger the error locally, run it to confirm the fix resolves the issue
- If no test exists, add a minimal test case that asserts the expected behavior

### Outputs
- A list of frames with file, line, and surrounding code
- Hypothesis statement
- Suggested patch (unified diff)

### Pitfalls
- **Path mismatches**: Stack traces may show paths from a different machine or build container. Always verify by searching for the file name or using fuzzy matching.
- **Optimized/minified code**: Line numbers may be off; look at the function name and surrounding context.
- **Async traces**: The true cause may be earlier in the call stack; walk back multiple frames if the immediate frame looks benign.
- **Third‑party frames**: Do not modify library code; instead adjust how you call it or wrap the call.

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] All frames mapped to existing files in the repo
- [ ] Hypothesis matches the error message
- [ ] Patch applies cleanly and does not introduce syntax errors
- [ ] Reproduction steps (if any) now pass
- [ ] No new lint or type errors introduced (run relevant linters if available)

### Example
```
Error: TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
    at processItems (/src/utils.js:42:23)
    at handleRequest (/src/routes.js:10:5)
```
1. Normalize paths → `src/utils.js`, `src/routes.js`
2. Read `src/utils.js` around line 42 → see `items.length` where `items` is undefined
3. Hypothesis: `processItems` called without checking that `items` is defined
4. Patch: Add `if (!items) return [];` at start of function
5. Verify: Run the request handler with a test that passes `undefined`; should now return empty array

## 2. local-llm-tooling (mlops)

### Purpose
Skills for running, prompting, and extracting structured output from local LLMs (e.g., Ollama, llama.cpp).

### When to Use
- You need to run an LLM locally for agent tasks, data extraction, or generation
- You want to avoid API rate limits, costs, or privacy concerns
- You are using tools like Ollama, llama.cpp, or text-generation-webui

### Detailed Workflow

#### Step 1: Choose and Start the Backend
- **Ollama**: `ollama run <model>` (handles server internally) or `ollama serve` then `ollama run`
- **llama.cpp**: Use `./main -m <model.gguf> -n 256 --repeat_last_n 64` or start the server mode
- **text-generation-webui**: `python server.py --model <path> --listen`
- Ensure the backend is listening on a known port (default Ollama: 11434, llama.cpp server: 8080)

#### Step 2: Verify the Model is Loaded
- Send a minimal probe request to confirm responsiveness
  - Ollama: `curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{"model":"<name>","prompt":"Hi","stream":false}'`
  - llama.cpp server: POST to `/completion` with similar payload
- Check for errors: model not found, OOM, or server not running

#### Step 3: Craft the Prompt
- Use clear, task-specific instructions
- For structured output, explicitly request JSON and specify the schema
  - Bad: "Extract the name and age."
  - Good: "Return a JSON object with exactly two fields: `name` (string) and `age` (integer). No extra text."
- If the model struggles with JSON, consider:
  - Using a format guard: "```json\n{...}\n```"
  - Asking for a short reasoning step first, then the JSON on a new line
- Keep prompts concise; long prompts increase latency and may exceed context window

#### Step 4: Handle Model Quirks
- **Stop tokens**: Configure the backend to stop at `\n\n` or a custom token to prevent runaway generation
- **Temperature**: Lower (0.1–0.3) for factual extraction; higher (0.7+) for creative tasks
- **Repeating prompts**: Some models echo the prompt; strip it from the response if needed
- **Tool use**: If the model was fine-tuned for tool calls (e.g., HuggingFace agents), adhere to its exact format

#### Step 5: Extract and Validate Output
- **Text parsing**: If JSON is requested, isolate the first `{` and last `}`; use a JSON parser with fallback
- **Validation**: Check that required fields exist and have correct types
- **Retry logic**: On parse failure, optionally:
  - Retry with a corrected prompt ("Your last response was not valid JSON. Please output only JSON.")
  - Fallback to a simpler schema or heuristic extraction

#### Step 6: Clean Up Resources
- When done, unload the model to free VRAM/RAM:
  - Ollama: `ollama stop <model>`
  - llama.cpp server: kill the process
  - Alternatively, keep it loaded if you'll reuse it soon to avoid reload latency

### Outputs
- Server process ID or endpoint
- Raw model response
- Parsed/structured data (if applicable)
- Latency and token usage metrics (if available from backend)

### Pitfalls
- **Context window overflow**: Long prompts + generation may exceed limits, causing truncation or errors. Measure token count.
- **Model hallucination**: Especially with weak prompts; always validate outputs against known facts or constraints
- **Server instability**: Some backends crash on invalid requests; start with a health check
- **Port conflicts**: Ensure the chosen port is free; check with `lsof -i:<port>`
- **VRAM exhaustion**: Monitor GPU memory; offload to CPU if needed (slower but works)

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] Backend server is running and reachable
- [ ] Model loads without OOM or errors
- [ ] A simple prompt returns a coherent response
- [ ] Structured output (if requested) parses to valid JSON/schema
- [ ] No stray text before/after JSON when isolation is attempted
- [ ] Resources can be cleaned up (server stops, memory freed)

### Example (Ollama)
```bash
# Start model
ollama run llama3:8b

# Probe
curl -s http://localhost:11434/api/generate \
  -d '{"model":"llama3:8b","prompt":"Say OK","stream":false}'

# Extraction task
response=$(curl -s http://localhost:11434/api/generate \
  -d '{
    "model":"llama3:8b",
    "prompt":"From this text: \"Apple Inc. was founded by Steve Jobs in 1976.\" Return JSON with fields: company (string), founder (string), year (integer). No extra text.",
    "stream":false,
    "options":{"temperature":0.1}
  }' | jq -r '.response')

# Parse and validate
}' | jq '{
  company: .company,
  founder: .founder,
  year: .year|tonumber
}'
```

## 3. intent-specification-protocol-skill (protocol)

### Purpose
State machine protocol forcing crystallization of intent into executable specs before coding. Addresses the bottleneck: specification quality, not model capability.

### When to Use
- Before writing any code, to formalize what the system should do
- When intent is vague or multi-step, requiring explicit state transitions
- To ensure alignment between human intent and generated code
- As a pre-coding step in agent workflows

### Research Basis
- **Project Prometheus** (2604.17464): Intent-driven specification for code generation
- **AdaCoder** (2504.04220): Adaptive intent specification for code completion
- **Self-repair research** (2604.10508): Iterative specification refinement

### Detailed Workflow

#### Step 1: Capture Raw Intent
- Collect natural-language description of desired behavior
- Identify constraints, edge cases, and success criteria

#### Step 2: Define State Machine
- Enumerate states (e.g., INITIAL, PARSING, VALIDATING, SPECIFIED, FAILED)
- Define transitions triggered by specification events
- Each state produces an artifact (raw intent → draft spec → validated spec → executable spec)

#### Step 3: Crystallize into Executable Spec
- Convert natural-language intent into machine-parseable format (JSON/YAML with strict types)
- Include preconditions, postconditions, and invariants
- Specify input/output schemas with exact types

#### Step 4: Validate Spec
- Check completeness: all states covered, all transitions defined
- Check consistency: no contradictory constraints
- Run automated checks if spec language supports them

#### Step 5: Lock and Commit
- Once spec is validated, lock it as the contract for code generation
- Any subsequent code must satisfy this spec

### Outputs
- State machine diagram or transition table
- Executable specification (JSON/YAML with schemas)
- Validation report

### Pitfalls
- Skipping spec step when intent seems "obvious" — leads to misalignment later
- Under-specifying edge cases — code passes simple tests but fails in production
- Over-specifying with premature optimization — wastes time, limits flexibility
- Treating spec as static — should evolve with new understanding

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] All states reachable from INITIAL
- [ ] All transitions have valid triggers
- [ ] Executable spec parses without errors
- [ ] Schema types match implementation language
- [ ] Edge cases have explicit handling in spec
