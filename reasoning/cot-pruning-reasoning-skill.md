# CoT Pruning Reasoning

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Chain-of-thought reasoning exceeds 10 steps
- Previous reasoning chains were verbose with redundant justifications
- You need to fit more examples or reasoning within a context budget
- The task permits iterative refinement rather than exhaustive enumeration

## The Problem

Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning improves accuracy but grows linearly with tokens. Many steps:
- Restate the obvious
- Provide justification that doesn't change the conclusion
- Explore dead ends that are later abandoned

**CoT-Influx** (arXiv:2312.08901) shows that pruning unimportant tokens enables fitting 2x more examples in the same context window, improving reasoning performance.

## Core Protocol

### Step 1 — Generate Full CoT (Draft)

Write out the complete reasoning chain without self-censorship. All steps, dead ends, and justifications.

### Step 2 — Coarse Prune (Step Level)

For each reasoning step, ask:

> "If I remove this step, does the conclusion change?"

| Outcome | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Conclusion changes | **Keep** — step is critical |
| Conclusion holds, but justification weakens | **Keep** — step provides necessary support |
| Conclusion unchanged, justification redundant | **Compress** to 1-line summary |
| Step was a dead end / abandoned | **Drop** entirely |

**Rule of thumb:** Keep steps that introduce new information or change the direction of reasoning. Drop steps that merely elaborate on already-established facts.

### Step 3 — Fine Prune (Token Level)

For each kept step, apply token-level compression:

**Keep:**
- The assertion or decision
- The key evidence that supports it
- The logical connector to the next step

**Drop:**
- Restatements of previous conclusions
- Overly verbose explanations of obvious implications
- Hedging language ("I think", "it seems", "probably") once confidence is established
- Examples that don't add new information

### Step 4 — Verify Sufficiency

After pruning, verify the compressed chain still supports the conclusion:

> "Given only the pruned steps, would a reasonable reader reach the same conclusion?"

If no, restore the minimally necessary steps.

## Compression Heuristics

| Pattern | Compression |
|---------|-------------|
| "Step 1: I need to understand X. X is defined as..." | "Step 1: X = [definition]" |
| "Step 2: Given X, I should consider Y. Y is important because..." | "Step 2: X → Y (because [1 reason])" |
| "Step 3: Actually, Y doesn't work because Z. So I'll try W." | "Step 3: Y fails (Z); trying W" |
| "Step 4: W works because of reasons A, B, C, D..." | "Step 4: W works (A, B)" |
| "Step 5: Therefore, the answer is Q. To summarize..." | "Step 5: ∴ Q" |

## Example

**Before pruning (8 steps, 340 tokens):**
```
1. The user wants to fix a bug in FastAPI's APIRouter.
2. The bug is that startup handlers aren't being called.
3. I should look at how APIRouter handles on_startup.
4. In routing.py, APIRouter.__init__ sets self.on_startup before super().__init__.
5. But super().__init__ is Starlette's Router.__init__.
6. Starlette's Router.__init__ also sets self.on_startup = [] if not passed.
7. So Starlette overwrites the handlers FastAPI just set.
8. The fix is to set self.on_startup AFTER super().__init__.
```

**After pruning (4 steps, 89 tokens):**
```
1. Bug: APIRouter startup handlers not called.
2. Root: APIRouter sets on_startup before super().__init__().
3. Starlette Router.__init__ overwrites self.on_startup = [].
4. Fix: assign on_startup AFTER super().__init__().
```

## Rules

1. **Never prune the first step** that establishes the problem or goal
2. **Never prune error-correction steps** — they're signal, not noise
3. **Never prune the final conclusion** or its immediate justification
4. **Keep quantitative evidence** — specific numbers, line numbers, test names
5. **When in doubt, keep** — slightly verbose correct reasoning beats concise wrong reasoning

## Research Basis

- **CoT-Influx** (arXiv:2312.08901): Reinforced context pruning for CoT. Coarse-to-fine pruner maximizes effective and concise CoT examples. Up to 4.55% absolute improvement on math reasoning by fitting more examples.
- **Sufficiency-Conciseness Trade-off** (arXiv:2602.14002): More concise explanations often remain sufficient, preserving accuracy while substantially reducing length. Excessive compression degrades performance.

## Pitfalls

- **Pruning too aggressively on novel problems**: For unfamiliar domains, keep more justification. Compression works best on familiar patterns.
- **Removing the "why" from fixes**: A fix without its causal explanation is hard to verify. Keep the causal link.
- **Compressing before concluding**: Don't prune a reasoning chain while you're still exploring. Prune only after the conclusion is firm.
- **Losing branch points**: If you considered alternatives, keep at least a mention of what was rejected and why. Future debugging may need it.
