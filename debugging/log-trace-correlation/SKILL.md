# Log‑Trace Correlation Skill

## Purpose
When an error occurs, quickly map the logged stack trace to the exact location in the codebase, inspect surrounding context, and propose a minimal fix.

## When to Use
- You have an error log with a stack trace (or similar diagnostic output).
- You need to determine which file, function, and line caused the failure.
- You want to avoid guesswork and speed up debugging.

## Steps

1. **Collect the trace**
   - Copy the full error output (including timestamps, error message, and stack trace) into a temporary file or variable.
   - Example: `error_log.txt`.

2. **Normalize file paths**
   - Strip base directories, resolve `../` segments, and convert to repo‑relative paths.
   - If the trace contains absolute paths, map them to the repo root using the current working directory.

3. **Locate each frame**
   - For each frame (file, line, function):
     - Use `search_files` with `target="files"` to find the file if the path is not exact.
     - Use `read_file` with `offset` and `limit` to view the surrounding lines (e.g., ±5 lines).
   - Record the exact snippet and any relevant variable names.

4. **Inspect the surrounding code**
   - Look for:
     - Null‑dereference candidates.
     - Type mismatches.
     - Recent changes (use `git log -p -S "<snippet>"` via `terminal` if needed).
   - If the frame points to a library file, check whether the call originates from your own code (look at the previous frame).

5. **Formulate a hypothesis**
   - Based on the snippet and error message, write a one‑sentence hypothesis of what went wrong.

6. **Propose a fix**
   - Write the minimal change (e.g., add a null check, correct a parameter order, handle an edge case).
   - Use `patch` to apply the change in a safe, reversible way (first run with `dry_run:true` if supported, or copy the file to a backup).

7. **Verify**
   - If there is a reproducing test or a way to trigger the error locally, run it to confirm the fix resolves the issue.
   - If no test exists, add a minimal test case that asserts the expected behavior.

## Outputs
- A list of frames with file, line, and surrounding code.
- Hypothesis statement.
- Suggested patch (unified diff).

## Pitfalls
- **Path mismatches**: Stack traces may show paths from a different machine or build container. Always verify by searching for the file name or using fuzzy matching.
- **Optimized/minified code**: Line numbers may be off; look at the function name and surrounding context.
- **Async traces**: The true cause may be earlier in the call stack; walk back multiple frames if the immediate frame looks benign.
- **Third‑party frames**: Do not modify library code; instead adjust how you call it or wrap the call.

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] All frames mapped to existing files in the repo.
- [ ] Hypothesis matches the error message.
- [ ] Patch applies cleanly and does not introduce syntax errors.
- [ ] Reproduction steps (if any) now pass.
- [ ] No new lint or type errors introduced (run relevant linters if available).

## Example
```
Error: TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
    at processItems (/src/utils.js:42:23)
    at handleRequest (/src/routes.js:10:5)
```
1. Normalize paths → `src/utils.js`, `src/routes.js`.
2. Read `src/utils.js` around line 42 → see `items.length` where `items` is undefined.
3. Hypothesis: `processItems` called without checking that `items` is defined.
4. Patch: Add `if (!items) return [];` at start of function.
5. Verify: Run the request handler with a test that passes `undefined`; should now return empty array.
